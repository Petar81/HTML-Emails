# HTML-Emails
My sample templates (responsive, Miscrosoft Office (mso) compatible, dark mode optimized...)

## About me

For the past 3 years I‘ve been working as a B2B and B2C email template developer at Robert Bosch (fortune 100 company and largest private employer in the world) and Zalando SE, Germany’s biggest e-commerce company. They are both part of DAX -  index of 40 selected German blue chip stocks traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

My responsibilities include developing highly responsive, personalized and localized html email templates, reusable block snippets (modules) and landing pages that are used by millions of customers on a daily basis across multiple countries, regions and continents.

Building ‘bulletproof’ templates and QA testing them with Litmus and other tools are equally important parts of my daily routine.
