# HTML-Emails
My sample templates (responsive, Miscrosoft Outlook (mso) compatible, dark mode optimized...)

## About me

My responsibilities include developing highly responsive, personalized and localized html email templates, reusable block snippets (modules) and landing pages that are used by millions of customers on a daily basis across multiple countries, regions and continents.

Building ‘bulletproof’ templates and QA testing them with Litmus and other tools are equally important parts of my daily routine.
